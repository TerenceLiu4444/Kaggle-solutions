my solutions to the kaggle competition I have attended

2018-data-science-bowl: computer vision project, I got silver medal (top 3%) using Mask-RCNN.

talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection: classification problem with time series. I got silver medal (top 2%) using light GBM.

google-landmark-recognition-challenge: classification problem with image. I got silver medal (top 6%) using ResNet50 and code from google-landmark-retrieval-challenge.

google-landmark-retrieval-challenge: image retrieval problem in computer vision. I got bronze medal (48/218) using DEep Local Features (DELF) for feature extraction and Faiss (a library developed by Facebook AI Research) for efficient similarity search.
